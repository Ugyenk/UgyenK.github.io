## Lesson 18: Database Transactions  

### What is a Transaction?
- A **transaction** is a group of operations done together as one task.
- Example: Transferring money from one account to another:
  - Read balance of Account A
  - Subtract amount from A
  - Add amount to Account B
  - Save both changes together

If any step fails, the whole transaction is canceled (rolled back).

---

### Why Transactions Matter?
- To keep the database **correct and reliable**, especially when:
  - Many users access it at the same time
  - There are unexpected issues (e.g., power failure)

---

### ACID Properties of Transactions
1. **Atomicity** – All operations happen or none do  
2. **Consistency** – Database remains correct before and after  
3. **Isolation** – Transactions don’t interfere with each other  
4. **Durability** – Once completed, the changes stay, even if system crashes  

---

### Transaction States
- **Active** – Doing the work
- **Partially Committed** – Almost done
- **Committed** – Successfully completed
- **Failed** – Something went wrong
- **Aborted** – Rolled back

---

### Issues Without Proper Transactions
- **Lost Update** – One update overwrites another
- **Dirty Read** – Reading data that was not yet committed
- **Unrepeatable Read** – Getting different results when reading same data twice
- **Phantom Read** – Rows appear/disappear between reads

---

###  Concurrency Control Techniques
- **Locking** – Prevents others from changing data while one is using it
- **Timestamp Ordering** – Orders transactions by time
- **Validation** – Checks before committing to avoid conflict

---

### Recovery Techniques
- **Log-based Recovery** – Keeps a record (log) of all operations
- **Shadow Paging** – Keeps a copy of data before changes

---

### Summary
- Transactions ensure **reliable, correct, and safe** changes in databases.
- **ACID** properties make them trustworthy.
- Recovery and concurrency control protect data from crashes and conflicts.

## Lesson 19: Concurrency Control & Recovery  

### What is Concurrency Control?
- **Concurrency control** ensures that multiple transactions can happen at the same time without messing up the database.
- It avoids problems like:
  - Two users updating the same data
  - One user reading data while another is changing it

---

###  Problems Without Concurrency Control
- **Lost Update** – Two changes at the same time; one gets lost  
- **Temporary Update (Dirty Read)** – Read uncommitted (temporary) data  
- **Incorrect Summary** – Read partial data while other updates are happening  
- **Unrepeatable Read** – Data changes between two reads  
- **Phantom Read** – New rows appear/disappear during a transaction  

---

###  Concurrency Control Methods

#### 1. **Lock-Based Protocols**
- **Shared Lock (S):** For reading
- **Exclusive Lock (X):** For writing
- **Two-Phase Locking (2PL):**
  - **Growing Phase:** Gets all locks
  - **Shrinking Phase:** Releases locks

#### 2. **Timestamp-Based Protocols**
- Every transaction gets a timestamp
- Ensures older transactions happen before newer ones

#### 3. **Validation-Based Protocols**
- Check for conflicts **before** committing

---

### Serializability
- A schedule (order of operations) is **serializable** if it gives the same result as if the transactions ran one by one.

---

### Deadlock in Transactions
- Happens when two transactions wait for each other’s locks
- **Solutions:**
  - **Wait-Die** and **Wound-Wait** (based on timestamps)
  - **Timeouts** – Cancel if waiting too long
  - **Deadlock Detection** – Use wait-for graph

---

### Recovery in Databases

#### Why Recovery?
- To bring the database back to a correct state after:
  - System crash
  - Power failure
  - Software bugs

#### Types of Storage:
- **Volatile Storage** – Loses data on crash (e.g., RAM)
- **Non-Volatile Storage** – Keeps data safe (e.g., hard disk)

---

### Recovery Techniques

#### 1. **Log-Based Recovery**
- Log stores all actions of transactions
- Use **UNDO** (rollback) or **REDO** (reapply)

#### 2. **Shadow Paging**
- Keeps a backup (shadow) of data before changes
- Swap if the transaction is successful

---

### Summary
- **Concurrency control** allows safe multi-user access  
- **Locking, timestamps, and validation** help avoid conflicts  
- **Recovery methods** like logging and shadow paging fix crashes  
- Together, they keep the database **safe, correct, and reliable**

## Lesson 20: Database Recovery

##  Why Database Recovery?

Databases must maintain **atomicity** and **durability**, even in the face of failures. If a system crashes during a transaction, we need a way to **roll back** partial changes or **reapply** completed transactions.

---

##  Types of Failures

| Type           | Description                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Transaction Failure | Errors in logic or constraint violations |
| System Crash   | Hardware/software crashes                   |
| Disk Failure   | Data loss due to disk corruption            |

---

## Logging and Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)

- All changes are **logged** before they're written to the database.
- **WAL Principle**: Log first, then update.

Each log record typically contains:
- Transaction ID
- Type (BEGIN, UPDATE, COMMIT, ABORT)
- Old and new values

 **Why logs?** So we can undo or redo changes during recovery.

---

##  Undo and Redo

- **Undo**: Reverses incomplete transactions.
- **Redo**: Reapplies committed transactions.

 Think of it like a time machine:
-  Undo goes backward.
-  Redo goes forward.

---

##  Checkpointing

Imagine saving your progress in a game. Checkpointing does the same!

- Periodically writes all dirty pages to disk.
- Adds a checkpoint log entry so recovery doesn't start from scratch.

 Improves recovery speed dramatically!

---

##  The ARIES Algorithm

ARIES (Algorithm for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics) is the **standard** for crash recovery.

### Three Phases:

1. **Analysis**
   - Determines dirty pages and active transactions at the crash time.

2. **Redo**
   - Repeats all actions since the last checkpoint (for committed transactions).

3. **Undo**
   - Rolls back uncommitted transactions using the **log records**.

ARIES uses a **Log Sequence Number (LSN)** to track and order operations.

---

##  Summary

- Recovery = Logging + Undo/Redo + Checkpointing
- WAL ensures logs are written before changes are made.
- ARIES is a powerful recovery algorithm used in most modern DBMSs.

---

## Fun Fact

> Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server all use **ARIES-inspired** recovery techniques. 

---

##  Conclusion

In Unit 6, we explored the core mechanisms that ensure **reliable, consistent, and safe** data operations in a database system. Transactions, concurrency control, and recovery aren't just abstract concepts—they are **real-world safeguards** that protect data integrity and user trust, especially in multi-user and failure-prone environments. By mastering these topics, you now understand how modern databases keep operations **atomic, isolated, durable, and correct**, even under stress.

##  Key Takeaways

- **Transactions** are groups of operations that must complete fully or not at all.
  
- The **ACID properties** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) are the foundation of reliable transactions.
  
- **Concurrency control** prevents data conflicts when multiple users access the database at the same time.
  
- Techniques like **locking**, **timestamps**, and **validation** manage concurrent transactions.
  
- Problems like **lost updates**, **dirty reads**, and **phantom reads** occur without proper control.
  
- **Recovery mechanisms** ensure data is restored after crashes or failures.
  
- **Logging** (using Write-Ahead Logging), **Undo/Redo**, and **Checkpointing** are key to recovery.
  
- The **ARIES algorithm** is a widely used recovery technique that efficiently handles system failures.
