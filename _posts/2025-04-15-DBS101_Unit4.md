## Key Concepts:

### **Joins in SQL**
- **Natural Join**: Combines two tables by matching columns with the same name. It removes duplicates and includes only consistent rows.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName 
    FROM Orders 
    INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
    ```

- **Inner Join**: Returns only rows with matching data in both tables, and excludes non-matching rows.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT * 
    FROM Orders 
    INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
    ```

- **Outer Joins**: Returns rows with matching data and includes rows with unmatched data from one or both tables.
  - **LEFT JOIN**: Includes unmatched rows from the left table, along with matching rows.
  - **RIGHT JOIN**: Includes unmatched rows from the right table, along with matching rows.
  - **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Includes unmatched rows from both tables, along with matching rows.

### **SQL Views**
- A **view** is a virtual table that stores the result of an SQL query. It doesn’t store data itself, but fetches data dynamically from the source tables each time it is accessed.
- **Materialized Views**: A type of view that stores data physically and is updated when the underlying data changes. This can improve performance for complex queries.

### **Integrity Constraints**
- **Entity Integrity**: Ensures that each row has a unique primary key and no duplicate rows exist.
- **Domain Constraints**: Limits the values a column can hold, such as setting a column to only accept integers or certain ranges.
- **Referential Integrity**: Ensures that foreign keys correctly point to valid primary keys in related tables, maintaining consistency across tables.
- **Key Constraints**: Defines the rules for primary keys (uniqueness) and foreign keys (relationships between tables).

### **SQL Data Types and Schemas**
- **Date and Time Types**: Used for storing date and time information (e.g., `DATE`, `TIME`).
- **Type Conversion**: You can convert between data types using functions like `CAST()`.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT CAST(ID AS numeric(5)) FROM instructor;
    ```
- **Default Values**: You can set default values for columns using the `DEFAULT` keyword.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    totcred numeric(3,0) DEFAULT 0;
    ```
- **Large Object Types**: Used to store large data like images, audio, or videos (e.g., `BLOB`, `CLOB`).
- **User-Defined Types**: Allows the creation of custom data types, such as defining a `Dollars` type for monetary values.
- **Auto Increment**: Automatically generates unique values for a column (e.g., `SERIAL` in PostgreSQL).

### **Create Table Extensions**
- You can create a new table that has the same schema as an existing table using the `LIKE` keyword.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE temp_instructor (LIKE instructor INCLUDING ALL);
    ```

# Lesson 10: Database Systems Fundamentals

## 1. **Schemas, Catalogs, and Environments**
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Databases have evolved from flat namespaces to hierarchical structures with catalogs, schemas, and relations.
- **User Connectivity**: Users connect to a database using unique credentials (username and password), with a default catalog and schema.
- **Three-Part Naming Convention**: Relations are identified by a catalog, schema, and relation name (e.g., `EHRDB.public.patient`).
- **Independence and Clashes**: Multiple catalogs and schemas enable users and applications to work independently without naming conflicts.
- **Schema Management**: Schemas can be created or dropped using SQL. Catalog management is system-specific.

## 2. **Index Definition in SQL**
- **Purpose of Indexes**: Indexes allow efficient data retrieval without full table scans.
- **Creating an Index**: 
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX deptindex ON instructor (deptname);
    ```
- **Unique Index**: Declare an index as unique if the search key is a candidate key:
    ```sql
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX deptindex ON instructor (deptname);
    ```
- **Dropping an Index**: 
    ```sql
    DROP INDEX index_name;
    ```

## 3. **Authorization**
- **Types of Authorization**: Authorizations include privileges for reading, inserting, updating, and deleting data.
- **Granting Privileges**: Use `GRANT` to give privileges on relations:
    ```sql
    GRANT SELECT ON department TO user;
    ```
- **Revoking Privileges**: Withdraw privileges using the `REVOKE` command. Prevent cascading revocation:
    ```sql
    REVOKE SELECT ON department FROM U2, U5 RESTRICT;
    ```
- **Role-based Authorization**: Create roles and assign privileges to them, which can be granted to users.
- **Views and Schemas**: A user who creates a view may not have all privileges on it. Schema owners can modify schemas.

## 4. **Accessing SQL from a Programming Language**
- **Dynamic SQL**: Programs can construct SQL queries dynamically at runtime and interact with the database using functions or methods. Common standards include:
    - **JDBC** (Java)
    - **ODBC** (Other languages)
  
- **Embedded SQL**: SQL statements are embedded within the source code and processed at compile time. Preprocessors translate SQL into function calls.

# Lesson 11: Functions and Procedures in SQL

*   **Functions** and **procedures** are blocks of code used to perform specific tasks in a database. They define the business logic and can be stored in the database.
    
*   **Functions**:
    
    *   Defined with CREATE FUNCTION.
        
    *   Return a single value.
        
    *   Can be executed within a SELECT statement.
        
    *   Cannot have output parameters.
        
*   **Procedures**:
    
    *   Defined with CREATE PROCEDURE.
        
    *   Can perform multiple actions.
        
    *   Must be explicitly called using EXECUTE.
        
    *   Can have output parameters.
        

### **2\. Example of Function:**

*   **get\_patient\_appointments**: This function retrieves patient appointments for a given patient ID.
    
*   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get\_patient\_appointments(p\_patient\_id INT)RETURNS TABLE (appointment\_id INT, appointment\_date DATE, appointment\_time TIME, purpose VARCHAR(255)) AS $$BEGIN RETURN QUERY SELECT a.AppointmentID, a.AppointmentDate, a.AppointmentTime, a.Purpose FROM Appointment a WHERE a.PatientID = p\_patient\_id ORDER BY a.AppointmentDate, a.AppointmentTime;END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
    

### **3\. Example of Procedure:**

*   **schedule\_appointment**: This procedure schedules a new appointment, checking doctor availability and inserting appointment data.
    
*   CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE schedule\_appointment( p\_patient\_id INT, p\_doctor\_id INT, p\_appointment\_date DATE, p\_appointment\_time TIME, p\_purpose VARCHAR(255))LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$BEGIN -- Check doctor's availability SELECT COUNT(\*) = 0 INTO doctor\_availability FROM Appointment WHERE DoctorID = p\_doctor\_id AND AppointmentDate = p\_appointment\_date AND AppointmentTime = p\_appointment\_time; IF NOT doctor\_availability THEN RAISE EXCEPTION 'Doctor is not available at the requested time'; END IF; -- Schedule appointment INSERT INTO Appointment (PatientID, DoctorID, AppointmentDate, AppointmentTime, Purpose) VALUES (p\_patient\_id, p\_doctor\_id, p\_appointment\_date, p\_appointment\_time, p\_purpose);END;$$;
    

### **4\. Language Constructs for Procedures and Functions**

*   SQL uses the **Persistent Storage Module (PSM)**, allowing constructs like loops, conditionals, and variable declarations to enhance the logic of functions and procedures.
    

### **5\. External Language Routines**

*   Some databases support external programming languages (e.g., Java, Python) within the SQL environment, but care must be taken to avoid security issues or corruption.
    

### **6\. Triggers in SQL**

*   **Triggers** are automatic actions that occur as a result of a modification to the database.
    
*   Used for enforcing integrity constraints, alerting users, or initiating tasks (e.g., updating related data or notifying users).
    
*   Example: **notify\_new\_prescription** trigger, which issues an alert whenever a new prescription is added.
    

### **7\. Example of Trigger:**

*   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION notify\_new\_prescription()RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$BEGIN RAISE NOTICE 'New prescription added: % for patient % (Medication: %)', NEW.PrescriptionID, NEW.PatientID, NEW.MedicationName; RETURN NEW;END;$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
    

### **8\. When Not to Use Triggers**

*   Triggers should be avoided when they might cause unintended actions during replication, lead to infinite loops, or conflict with other database operations.
    
# Lesson 12 Summary: Recursion & Advanced Aggregation in SQL

#### **Learning Outcomes:**

1.  Understand and write **recursive queries** in SQL.
    
2.  Use **advanced aggregation** features in SQL.
    

### **Recursion in SQL:**

*   **Definition**: A recursive SQL **Common Table Expression (CTE)** is a query that references its own output until a termination condition is met. It’s ideal for querying **hierarchical data**.
    
*   WITH R AS (SELECT 1 AS n)SELECT n + 1 FROM R
    
    *   R is the recursive CTE, starting with a base query (SELECT 1 AS n) and referencing itself in subsequent operations.
        
*   **Transitive Closure**:
    
    *   If (a1, a2) ∈ R and (a2, a3) ∈ R, then (a1, a3) ∈ R.
        
    *   Recursive queries are useful for expressing **transitive closure**.
        
*   **Structure of Recursive Queries**:
    
    *   Must include:
        
        1.  A **base case** (non-recursive query).
            
        2.  A **recursive case** (refers to the CTE itself).
            
    *   Defined using WITH RECURSIVE.
        

#### **Restrictions on Recursive Queries**:

*   Recursive queries must be **monotonic**.
    
*   Cannot use:
    
    *   Aggregation on the recursive view.
        
    *   NOT EXISTS subqueries on the recursive view.
        
    *   EXCEPT where the recursive view is on the right side.
        

### **Advanced Aggregation**:

*   Mentioned as part of the lesson but left for an **exercise**.
