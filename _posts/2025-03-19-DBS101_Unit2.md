## Overview
The **Entity-Relationship (ER) Model** is a conceptual framework used to design databases. It represents the logical structure of a database using **entities, attributes, and relationships**.

## Key Concepts
- **Entity**: A real-world object with distinct characteristics.
- **Attributes**: Properties that describe an entity.
- **Relationships**: Associations between entities.

## Primary Key
A **primary key** uniquely identifies each record in an entity set. It must be unique and not null.

## Mapping Cardinalities
Defines how entities are related:
- **One-to-One**
- **One-to-Many**
- **Many-to-One**
- **Many-to-Many**

## Special Concepts
- **Weak Entities**: Entities that depend on another entity.
- **Generalization & Specialization**: Defining hierarchical relationships between entities.
- **Aggregation**: Treating relationships as higher-level entities.

## Relational Model  

### Learning Outcomes  
1. Understand database design.  
2. Learn relational data models.  
3. Use entity-relationship diagrams.  
4. Identify attributes and keys.  

### Relational Model  
A database is made up of **tables** (relations).  
Each table contains **rows** (tuples) and **columns** (attributes).  

#### Key Terms  
- **Relation** → A table.  
- **Tuple** → A row in a table.  
- **Attribute** → A column in a table.  
- **Primary Key** → A unique identifier for each row.  
- **Foreign Key** → A reference to another table.  

### Example Table: Students  
| StudentNo | Name  | Address  | Programme_ID |  
|-----------|-------|----------|--------------|  
| 12345     | Sonam | Thimphu  | BESWE        |  
| 24656     | Tandin | Paro     | BEIT         |  

### Example Table: Programmes  
| Programme_ID | Programme_Name | Start_Year |  
|--------------|---------------|------------|  
| BESWE       | Software Eng.  | 2023       |  
| BEIT        | IT             | 2011       |  

### Keys in a Table  
- **Primary Key** → Uniquely identifies a row (e.g., `StudentNo`).  
- **Foreign Key** → Connects tables (e.g., `Programme_ID` in Students table).  

### How to Find a Student's Department?  
We need **three tables**:  
1. **Students** → Contains `Programme_ID`.  
2. **Programmes** → Contains `Dept_ID`.  
3. **Departments** → Contains `Dept_Name`.  

By linking these, we can find each student’s department.  

### Schema Diagram  
A **schema diagram** shows table relationships.  
Example:  
- `Student(StudentNo, Name, Address, Programme_ID)`  
- `Programme(Programme_ID, Programme_Name, Start_Year, Dept_ID)`  
- `Department(Dept_ID, Dept_Name, HOD)`  

##  ERD to Relational Schema  

### Converting ER Model to Relational Schema  
Both **ER models** and **relational models** represent real-world data.  
Since they follow similar design principles, we can **convert an ER model** into a relational schema.  

### Steps to Convert ER Diagram to Schema  
1. **Create a table for each entity.**  
   - Attributes → Columns  
   - Primary Key → Unique identifier  

2. **Handle multivalued attributes.**  
   - Use a separate table.  

3. **Convert composite attributes.**  
   - Only **sub-attributes** become columns.  

4. **Derived attributes are not stored.**  

5. **Convert relationships into tables.**  
   - Combine primary keys from related entities.  
   - Include any descriptive attributes.  

### Handling Cardinality  
- **1:1 Relationship**  
  - One entity takes the foreign key of the other.  
  - If both have full participation, either can take it.  

- **1:N Relationship**  
  - The "many" side takes the foreign key of the "one" side.  

- **M:N Relationship**  
  - Create a new table with foreign keys from both entities.  

### Handling Special Cases  
- **Unary (Recursive) Relationships**  
  - **1:1** → Foreign key references the same table.  
  - **1:N** → Use a recursive foreign key.  
  - **M:N** → Create a new table.  

- **Ternary Relationships (3+ entities)**  
  - Requires a new table.  
  - Primary key → Combination of participating entities' keys.  

### Mapping Specialization/Generalization  
- **Method 1:** Each entity has its own table.  
  - `Student(Regno, Name)`  
  - `PosGrad(Regno, Supervisor)`  
  - `UnderGrad(Regno, Points)`  

- **Method 2:** Only subclasses have tables.  
  - `PosGrad(Regno, Name, Supervisor)`  
  - `UnderGrad(Regno, Name, Points)`  

- **Method 3:** Only the superclass has a table.  
  - `Student(Regno, Name, Supervisor, Points)`  
  - This may introduce **NULL values**.  

### Aggregation in Relational Model  
- No separate table is needed for aggregation.  
- The **defining relationship's table** is used.  

### Entities vs Attributes  
- Use an **entity** when you need to store extra details.  
- Use **attributes** for simple properties.  

### Entities vs Relationships  
- Use relationships to define actions between entities.  
- **Binary relationships** are simpler, but **n-ary** can model complex interactions.  

### Unified Modeling Language (UML)  
- ER diagrams focus on **data** representation.  
- UML models **entire software systems** using:  
  - **Class diagrams**  
  - **Use case diagrams**  
  - **Activity diagrams**  
  - **Implementation diagrams**
