# Relational Database Design and Normalization

## 1. Features of Good Relational Database Designs
A well-designed relational database ensures:
- **Data Integrity:** Strongly enforced rules like foreign key constraints maintain the consistency of related data across tables.
- **Optimized Queries:** Carefully structured tables and indexed columns improve query performance, enabling faster data retrieval.
- **Data Scalability:** A good database design allows seamless integration of new features or tables without disrupting existing ones.
- **Logical Organization:** The use of clear table relationships (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many) ensures easy interpretation and maintenance.

## 2. Decomposing Relational Schemas Using Functional Dependencies

### What Are Functional Dependencies?
- A **functional dependency (FD)** exists when one attribute (or a group of attributes) uniquely determines another attribute.
    - Example: In a Student table, `StudentID -> StudentName` implies each `StudentID` corresponds to exactly one `StudentName`.

### Why Decompose Using FDs?
- Large tables may contain redundant data, leading to anomalies. Decomposing tables using functional dependencies ensures data consistency and minimizes redundancy.

### Practical Steps:
1. Identify **functional dependencies** in the given table.
2. Split the table into smaller tables based on dependencies while:
    - Preserving relationships between attributes.
    - Ensuring that the decomposition is **lossless** (no data is lost).

#### Example:
For a table with `{OrderID, ProductID, ProductName, CustomerID, CustomerName}`:
- If `CustomerID -> CustomerName` and `ProductID -> ProductName`, you can decompose it into two tables:
  1. `{CustomerID, CustomerName, OrderID}`
  2. `{OrderID, ProductID, ProductName}`

## 3. Implementing Normal Forms for Database Normalization

### First Normal Form (1NF):
- Ensure all columns contain **atomic values**.
- Eliminate repeating groups or arrays.
- Example:
  - Non-atomic table:
    | StudentID | Subjects          |
    |-----------|-------------------|
    | 1         | Math, Science     |
  - 1NF-compliant table:
    | StudentID | Subject  |
    |-----------|----------|
    | 1         | Math     |
    | 1         | Science  |

### Second Normal Form (2NF):
- Eliminate **partial dependencies**.
- A column should only depend on the entire primary key, not part of it.
- Example:
    If `OrderID + ProductID` is a composite key, then `CustomerName` depends only on `OrderID`, which violates 2NF.

### Third Normal Form (3NF):
- Eliminate **transitive dependencies**.
- A non-primary attribute should not depend on another non-primary attribute.
- Example:
    If `StudentID -> DepartmentID -> DepartmentName`, remove `DepartmentName` to create a separate table `{DepartmentID, DepartmentName}`.

### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):
- A stricter version of 3NF; ensures every functional dependency has a **superkey** as its determinant.

## 4. Functional Dependency Theory

### Key Concepts:
- **Closure of Attributes:** Determines all attributes that can be functionally derived from a set of attributes.
  - Example: If `A -> B` and `B -> C`, then `A -> C` is derived.
- **Candidate Keys:** Minimal set of attributes that uniquely identify a record.
  - Example: `{OrderID, ProductID}` in a composite key.
- **Canonical Cover:** Minimal set of functional dependencies that retains the original FD setâ€™s properties.

### Importance:
This theory provides the foundation for designing and validating relational schemas, ensuring all dependencies are represented efficiently.

---

## 5. Algorithms for Decomposition Using Functional Dependencies

### Lossless Decomposition Algorithm:
1. Identify all **candidate keys** and **functional dependencies**.
2. Divide the attributes into smaller tables ensuring:
   - The original table can be reconstructed (lossless join).
   - Functional dependencies are preserved (dependency preservation).

### Dependency Preservation:
- Verify that each functional dependency can still be enforced in the decomposed schema.

#### Example:
For a table `{A, B, C, D}` with `A -> B`, `B -> C`:
- Step 1: Identify functional dependencies.
- Step 2: Decompose into `{A, B}`, `{B, C}`, and `{A, D}`.
- Step 3: Verify the decomposition preserves dependencies and supports lossless joins.

# Advanced Database Design Concepts

## 1. Decomposing Schemas Using Multivalued Dependencies

### What Are Multivalued Dependencies?
- A **multivalued dependency (MVD)** exists when one attribute determines a set of values for another, independently of other attributes in the schema.
    - Example: In a `Movie` table with `{Title, Actor, Genre}`, each `Title` can be associated with multiple `Actors` and multiple `Genres`.

### Why Decompose Using MVDs?
- Multivalued dependencies can lead to redundancy and anomalies in data, similar to functional dependencies.
- Decomposition resolves these issues while maintaining the original data relationships.

### Practical Steps:
1. Identify the **multivalued dependencies** in the schema.
2. Decompose the table into smaller tables to eliminate redundancy.
3. Ensure the decomposition is **lossless** and preserves dependencies.

#### Example:
For a table `{StudentID, Course, Hobby}`:
- If `StudentID ->> Course` and `StudentID ->> Hobby` (MVDs), decompose into:
  1. `{StudentID, Course}`
  2. `{StudentID, Hobby}`

---

## 2. Understanding Additional Normal Forms

### Fourth Normal Form (4NF):
- A table is in 4NF if it is in **BCNF** and has no **non-trivial multivalued dependencies**.
- Eliminates redundancy caused by MVDs.
- Example:
  - A table `{StudentID, Course, Hobby}` with `StudentID ->> Course` and `StudentID ->> Hobby` should be split as shown above.

### Fifth Normal Form (5NF) or Project-Join Normal Form (PJNF):
- A table is in 5NF if it is in 4NF and cannot be further decomposed into smaller tables without losing information.
- Addresses redundancy caused by **join dependencies**.

### Domain-Key Normal Form (DKNF):
- Ensures all constraints are represented by domain constraints and key constraints, minimizing anomalies.

## 3. Applying Concepts of Atomic Domains and 1NF

### Atomic Domains:
- Domains where each value is indivisible or atomic.
- Example:
  - Non-atomic domain: `{Name: "John, Jane"}`
  - Atomic domain: `{Name: "John"}, {Name: "Jane"}`

### First Normal Form (1NF):
- A table satisfies 1NF if:
  - All attributes contain **atomic values**.
  - There are no repeating groups or arrays.
- Example:
  - Non-atomic table:
    | StudentID | Subjects          |
    |-----------|-------------------|
    | 1         | Math, Science     |
  - 1NF-compliant table:
    | StudentID | Subject  |
    |-----------|----------|
    | 1         | Math     |
    | 1         | Science  |

## 4. Evaluating Systematic Design Processes

### Steps in a Systematic Design Process:
1. **Requirement Analysis:**
   - Gather and analyze user requirements to identify entities, attributes, and relationships.
2. **Conceptual Design:**
   - Use Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams to represent data and relationships visually.
3. **Logical Design:**
   - Convert the ER model into a relational schema.
4. **Normalization:**
   - Apply normalization rules to remove redundancy and anomalies.
5. **Physical Design:**
   - Define storage structures, indexing, and query optimization.

### Benefits:
- Ensures a logical and efficient database structure.
- Reduces the risk of anomalies and redundancy.
- Enhances scalability and performance.

## 5. Modeling Temporal Data in Database Designs

### Challenges of Temporal Data:
- Representing data that changes over time.
- Maintaining historical records and future projections.

### Temporal Modeling Techniques:
1. **Valid-Time and Transaction-Time:**
   - Use two timestamps:
     - **Valid-Time:** When the data is true in the real world.
     - **Transaction-Time:** When the data is stored in the database.

2. **Temporal Tables:**
   - Add additional columns for timestamps to track changes over time.
   - Example:
     | EmployeeID | Salary | StartDate  | EndDate    |
     |------------|--------|------------|------------|
     | 1          | 50000  | 2023-01-01 | 2024-01-01 |

3. **Bitemporal Data:**
   - Combines valid-time and transaction-time for comprehensive tracking.

### Temporal Querying:
- Specialized SQL clauses (e.g., `PERIOD`, `AS OF`) enable querying historical and future data.
